# Introduction

After setting up the network nodes, as well as the genesis block and the network itself, we are ready to initialize the two nodes and begin the mining process. 

# Initialize the Two Nodes

You can initialize the two nodes using the network json file that was previous created

## Initialize the first network node

Run the following command to initialize the first network node:
    ./geth init zbank_test_network.json --datadir node1

You will know that this was successful if you see the "Successfully wrote genesis state" message at the end of your code.

## Initialize the second network node

Run the following command to initialize the second network node:
    ./geth init zbank_test_network.json --datadir node2

You will know that this was successful if you see the "Successfully wrote genesis state" message at the end of your code.
